# Single-Core Optimization


This series of lectures is about code optimization on single-core.

1.  We start from scratch, revising some basic features of the [architecture of modern cpus](01 - Modern architecture.pdf) after a brief [historical review](00 - no more free lunch.pdf) of the reasons that led to them.
2.  We then introduce [some general concepts](02 - optimization - preliminary and basic compiler usage.pdf) about what “optimization” is, settling some common terms, and the usage of the compiler.
3.  The [running and memory model](03 - Heap stack and memory model.pdf) in the **niX* environment is discussed in some detailed, with a focus on the stack and the heap memory.
4.  Some more detailed facts about [memory allocation](04 - memory allocation.pdf) are exposed.
5.  …
